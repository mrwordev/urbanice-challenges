# Challenges
> Please use React-native Framework
Create new controller call “Test”
3, 5, 9, 15, X  - Please create new function for finding X value
(Y + 24)+(10 × 2) = 99  - Please create new function for finding Y value
If 1 = 5 , 2 = 25 , 3 = 325 , 4 = 4325 Then 5 = X - Please create new function for finding X value
** Make sure we have cache for every functions **
#### Technology
What I use in this setup is React Native cli setupt not Expo, so you will need to install either Android Studio or Xcode to run this applicaition.
Requirements:
- Node and Npm install
- Xcode or Android install

**Please follow the guide to install React Naitve CLI [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)**

Pull project, and navigate to project folder via console and execute following command.

    npm install


Easiest way will be using Android Phone connect to the computer and run the follwing command:

    adb devices

For iOS you should skip section to here.
Once you have any device connected run the command

    /* iOS */
    react-native run-ios
    /* Android */
    react-native run-android

You should be able to run this project without any problem.

# Solution
There is three main question for the challenge which include usign React Native framework.
Most of logical part is store in **Utilities** file. The solution and explantion is already include within the app. **Text.js** should store all explanation in case of the application cannot run from your machine.

Note: It can run on my machine, so if you cannot run it contact me via mrrkdesign@gmail.com
